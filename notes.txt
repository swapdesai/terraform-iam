What best describes an IAM role
* A role is something that another entity can "assume."
* A role is something that another entity can "assume,"
* where the entity is another AWS resource like an EC2 instance.
* AWS resources cannot have permission polices directly applied to them,
* so to access another resource they must "assume" a role and gain permissions assigned to the role.
